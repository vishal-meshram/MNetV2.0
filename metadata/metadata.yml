name: 'MNet: V2.0 (An Updated Framework to Reduce pranayama Image Misclassification)'
description: Fast and accurate image classification remains a significant challenge
  in the field. to address this issue, we have modified old framework called "MNet"
  by using two separate models called "MobileNet"  and "NASNetMobile". we have used
  Pranayama dataset to test this new framework. MobileNet is used to classify the
  type of pranayama wheras NasNetMobile is used to classify "Right" or "Wrong" posture.
